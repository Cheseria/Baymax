### Architecture 
<img src="../src/img/Architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture" width="800" height="500">

The picture above shows the architecture with explanation below: <br>
Within this client server pattern software architecture, the **login page** as well as the **main page** will be presented as a **front end** and will utilise the **login.php** to get the user input for **username and password**, the system can then be **queried** for the whether or not the information given by the user has been stored in the **database**. Users also can store their data by click **"Register"** and it will generate **register.php** to get the user input for **username and password**, the system then will **store** the data to the **database**. 

The **main page** will also show the **calendar** that is generated by **calendar.php**, the main page will also feature the **category and event functions** which allows the user to **add and delete** both categories and events respectively which have generated by both **Add_Category.php** , **delete_category.php** and **Add_Event.php** , **delete_event.php**. For every added or deleted event or category will be updated within the database and will then be displayed on the main page which is generated through the calendar.php.

**Config** is used to establish connection from the web server to the database. **logout** is used to destroy the session.

### Database Tables
<img src="../src/img/Database_Tables.png" alt="Database_Tables" width="700" height="500"> 

The picture above shows the database diagram with explanation below: <br>
**User** utillises a **username and password** to access the system to create and schedule events as they see fit , the user would also specifcy the **description** of **event** as well as the **date and time**. The **event** will be assigned an **event id** by the system which will be used as a **primary key** by the system to access the **user id** when needed. The user will also be able to create a **category** which will have a **category id** which can be used to store and access multiple events within said category.
